/**
 * Calculate the interest portion of a payment for a given period of a set
 * payment stream.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The formula leverages the `pmt` and `fv` functions. Essentially, it
 * calculates what the future value is at the start of the target period. Since
 * rate is constant for the period, fv * rate will provide the interest portion
 * during that period.
 *
 * @param rate - Interest rate per the period
 * @param per - Specific period
 * @param nper - Number of periods
 * @param pv - Present value
 * @param fv - Future value
 * @param type - When payments are due. false = end of period (default). true =
 * beginning of period
 * @returns The calculated interest portion
