/**
 * Calculate the internal rate of return of a series of regular cash flows.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Negative values represent investments, and positive values represent returns.
 *
 * Essentially, the algorithm uses the secant method to find a rate where the
 * net present value is equal to 0, stepping through the calculations
 * iteratively. Once the rate is within the Epsilon tolerance, the approximate
 * rate is returned.
 *
 * @param values - A set of periodic cash flows
 * @param guess - A guess at the rate
 * @returns The internal rate of return
