# Final Project

1. My project is a financial calculator.  It is modeled after the BA II Plus calculator.  It enables a user to compute five essential financial calculations, that most college business students and working professionals use regularly--it also performs basic calculations.  The financial computions in the calculator are; Number of Periods (N), Interest Rate (I/Y), Present Value (PV), Payment (PMT), and Future Value (FV).

2. The library I used was forked from finance.js, by a developer named @travishorn.  His fork of finance.js incorporated more simplified functions.

3. "browserify main.js -p esmify > bundle.js"  needs to be run in the terminal upon making changes to my javascript code. 

4. I also incorporated a .JSON file that contains 99 financial facts. When the page is refreshed, a random fact is fetched from the .JSON file.
